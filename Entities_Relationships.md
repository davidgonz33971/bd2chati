- A User can be Client OR Employee, never both
- An Employee can be Driver OR Staff, never both
- Admins/Managers exist only in User (no child record)
```

# USER
Base identity for all system users (clients, employees, admins, managers).
# CLIENT
Extension of User for customers who request delivery services.
# EMPLOYEE
Extension of User for post office workers (common to drivers and staff).
# EMPLOYEE_DRIVER
Sub-entity of Employee for drivers. Exclusive with Employee_Staff.
# EMPLOYEE_STAFF
Sub-entity of Employee for office/warehouse staff. Exclusive with Employee_Driver.
# WAREHOUSE
Physical post office locations/warehouses.
# VEHICLE
Fleet vehicles used for deliveries.
# INVOICE
Record of services a client wants to send + payment. Snapshot fields (name, address, contact) preserve client info at creation time for record integrity.
# INVOICE_ITEM
Individual line items within an Invoice.
# ROUTE
A driver's journey from a warehouse carrying deliveries.
# DELIVERY
Individual package to be delivered. Sender/recipient info is stored as flattened snapshot fields because they may not be registered users.
# DELIVERY_TRACKING
Append-only event log recording every status change of a delivery. Each row represents an event — when, where, who, and to which status.
  The DELIVERY table holds only the current status. DELIVERY_TRACKING stores all past statuses, allowing the full journey of a package to be traced.
  How it is populated
  Through the trigger trg_delivery_tracking_log, which fires automatically AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF status ON DELIVERY. Whenever a delivery's status changes (via sp_update_delivery_status()), the trigger inserts a new row into DELIVERY_TRACKING with the del_id, new status, staff_id, war_id, and timestamp — with no application-level logic required in Django.

# NOTIFICATION (MongoDB - ignore for PostGreSQL)
Notification records stored in MongoDB.
| Attribute         | Type     | Constraints |

| id               | ObjectId | PK (auto)   |
